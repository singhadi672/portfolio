    <h1>Future Of Flutter in 2020</h1>

    <p>The simple answer to both concerns is to develop a Cross-Platform Mobile application with a unique idea.
        It is true that majorly enterprises and startups have two primary options for mobile app development (Cross-platform and Native apps). Still, due to the lack of budget and funding to build a Native Android and iOS app, startups choose to go for Cross-platform applications.
        Besides, Here are the reasons to choose Software Development Company to create a cross-platform application:
        Low-Cost App Development
        Building a native app can be a costly deal for the startups as developers have to write different codes for developing applications for various operating systems. On the other hand, a single code base has been used to create applications that flawlessly work on multiple platforms and therefore, it efficiently reduces the app maintenance cost.
        Quick To Develop Cross-Platform Application
        As Cross-Platform apps are developed with a single code base; therefore, there is no need of writing codes repeatedly to make your app run on different operating systems. Writing less code will free up the developer to work on the next app development project.
        Plugins Are Easy To Avail
        When it comes to developing a cross-platform application, developers have a wide choice of plugins which make the entire app development process more comfortable and flawless.
        Less Efforts To Test App
        While developing a cross-platform application, you donâ€™t need to hire a developer to check app performance for two different platforms. QA experts have to check only one version of the application, therefore devote less time on testing.
        Reusability of Code
        The comfort of reusability of code is one of the most significant advantages that a cross-platform app development framework offers you. A single code can be used for multiple platforms, so developers can save half of their coding time that they devote to develop native apps.</p>
